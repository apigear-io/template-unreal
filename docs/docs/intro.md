# Template Unreal Engine

This is the documentation for the _Unreal Engine_ template for the [ApiGear](/docs/guide/quick-start) code generator.

It generates Unreal Engine plugins from your API definitions, with full support for Blueprints and C++.

The documentation is split into the following sections:

- [Quick-Start](quickstart/index.md?current-template=template-unreal) is the easiest way to get started
- [Features](features/features.md) explains the available code generator features, what code is generated, and how to use it
